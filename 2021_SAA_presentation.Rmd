# Regression adjustment

The __actual density__ of archaeological sites, $\lambda(s)$, is the outcome of scientific interest. Simple log-linear model:

$$ log\; \lambda(s) = \alpha + \beta x(s) $$
<br>

--

However, this is subject to __sampling bias__, $b(s)$. Also, a simple log-linear model:

$$ log\; b(s) = \gamma + \delta z(s) $$
<br>

--

Simple linear response means we can combine them into a joint model of the __observed density__:

$$ log\; \lambda(s)b(s) = (\alpha + \gamma) + \beta x(s) + \delta z(s) $$



---

## Density Model

$$ \lambda(s) = \text{Time Period} * (\text{Lake} + \text{Springs} + \text{Streams}) $$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

figure("density-explanatory.png")

```



---

## Observation Model

$$ b(s) = \text{Distance to Road} + \text{Deposition Age} $$

## Lingering Issues 

__Environmental homogeneity__.   

--

- Hard to tease out environmental drivers of settlement.  

<br>

--

__Sampling bias__, again.   

--

- This analysis accounts for only _surface_ sampling bias, and that only partially.
- Heaps of sampling bias likely still occur in intensely surveyed areas.

<br>

--

__Equifinality__.

--

-  The same observed density, $\lambda(s)b(s)$, could result from 
  - different combinations of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, and
  - different combinations of $x(s)$ and $z(s)$ when those are highly correlated.

## Conclusion

Need to...

--

* expand __geographic range__.

--

* invest in more __targeted inventory__, and

--

* incorporate __research history__ as prior.
